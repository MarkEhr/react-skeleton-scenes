My own react boilerplate for a SPA PWA.

Intended to create apps inside the TIDE stack.

This is based in scenes, see [this article](https://medium.com/@alexmngn/how-to-better-organize-your-react-applications-2fd3ea1920f1) to understand the architecture.

To deploy, you can use script `deploy-dev.sh`,
ensure you have HOST and PATH environment variables set.

Example:

    HOST=example.com PATH=www/my-app ./deploy-dev.sh
